SURVEY 1 HELPFUL RESPONSES:
Naming of buttons: perhaps "Host/Join" to "Host/Join Game", "Help" to "Instructions/How to play"
IP Address issues
Scoring
pretty even split between click and drag and scroll
Hosting: also have to click join?
show who's turn
return to main menu
quit button to leave game
font a/o similarity
hints/no hints

additional notable quotes:
Do you have any questions regarding what the buttons above mean?
	Lazers
How would you start playing an existing game?
	I would look for a game and ask "Can I play?"
Do you know how to find your IP Address without further instructions?
	Something with network settings and pressing buttons and things - fancy magical things.
Do you know how to find your IP...?
	No, help me please
How would yous start playing a game if you would like to host?
	Enter a game name, like "penis", your IP, and click start

What we should do/change:
Help->Instructions(maybe even FAQs)
auto IP address? facilitate host address input?
Probably just scroll
Add scoring/finalize board design/who's turn
explicitly state whether we should click to host and then join or if simply clicking host is sufficient
return buttons
quit button not necessary, x already there
font change not necessary
hint option - very important. Should be in settings I think.
